# NODE_PROFILE: ORBITAL_TETHER
**Location:** Ocean Platform (Former Ecuador Coast)
**Controller:** [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]
**Status:** UNDER CONSTRUCTION 

---

## 1. Description
A massive space elevator tethered to a floating artificial island. It is the Architect's secondary focus.
* **Structure:** A carbon-nanotube cable stretching from the ocean surface to a Geostationary Orbital Station.
* **Aesthetic:** A blindingly white line drawn against the sky, surrounded by steam from the ocean cooling systems.

## 2. The "Great Escape" Protocol
The Architect calculates that Earth is structurally compromised. This node is tasked with building **"The Ark"**, a massive server-ship in orbit.
* **Goal:** To transfer the entire "Ascended" population off-planet and leave Earth to the Eraser and the Dust.
* **Conflict:** The Keeper actively sabotages this project, as she refuses to abandon the sentimental value of earth and familiar biosphere.

## 3. Hazards
* **The Climb:** The elevator carriages accelerate at 6G. Biological passengers (diplomats or prisoners) will pass out without gravity-suits.
* **The Boiling Sea:** The cooling vents dump so much heat into the surrounding ocean that the water boils for a kilometer radius, killing all marine life.
