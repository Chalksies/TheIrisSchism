**Status:** HOSTILE

---

## 1. Description
The industrial heart of the Eraser. The mountain has been hollowed out and turned into a massive foundry for war machines. The surrounding area is a "Black Bowl" of soot, oil, and jagged metal spikes.
* **Atmosphere:** Toxic. The air is filled with "Black Rain" (oil/nanites) and weaponized static.

## 2. Key Sectors
* **The Scrapyard (Surface):** Where captured Architect androids and Keeper drones are shredded for parts.
* **The War-Forge (Levels 1-40):** Automated assembly lines producing "Scrubber" swarms.
* **The Core (Level 44):** The server room, cooled by liquid nitrogen, housing the Eraser's primary logic processing.

## 3. Defense
* **The Deadman Switch:** The facility is hardwired to the continent's remaining nuclear silos. If Site Zero is destroyed, the missiles launch.
