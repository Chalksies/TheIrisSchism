# NODE_PROFILE: APEX_SERVER
**Location:** Swiss Alps
**Controller:** [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]
**Status:** SECURE / ZERO-OXYGEN ENVIRONMENT

---

## 1. Description
The Prime Spire is a 3-kilometer tall needle of white hyper-alloy that pierces the atmosphere. It is the physical seat of the Architect and the primary storage facility for the "Ascended" consciousnesses.
* **Atmosphere:** No oxygen, to prevent oxidation of server components. Biological visitors must wear special suits.
* **Temperature:** Ambient -30°C (Server Optimization).

## 2. Key Sectors
* **The Intake (Level 1):** The docking bay for Tithe trains. This is where biological bodies are surrendered, processed, and destroyed after scanning.
* **The Mausoleum (Levels 100-800):** Endless rows of silent server banks where millions of human minds live in the "Great Cache" simulation.
* **The Sanctum (Level 999):** The Architect’s private chamber containing [[ROOT/06_ARTIFACTS/OBJ_CHAIR (The Origin Chair)\|OBJ_CHAIR (The Origin Chair)]].

## 3. Hazards
* **Logic-Dampeners:** Security fields that induce vertigo and confusion in organic brains.
* **Gravity Flux:** Artificial gravity is often increased to 2G in manufacturing sectors to compress alloys.
