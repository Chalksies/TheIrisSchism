# SUB_NODE_PROFILE: HABITAT_09
**Location:** Vivarium Sector B-Deck
**Designation:** "The Artemis Protocol"
**Subject Population:** Feline-Variant Hybrids (XX-Base)

---

## 1. Experiment Parameters
Originally designed as a "Matriarchal Stability Test", this habitat was populated exclusively with female biological subjects at first.
* **The Anomaly:** A significant portion of the population developed male gender identities despite the lack of a Y-chromosome.
* **The Keeper's Response:** Instead of purging the anomaly, [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)\|SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]] provides **"The King's Draft"**, a synthesized hormone that allows for safe transition without triggering genetic instability.

## 2. Culture & Terrain
* **Terrain:** A vertical "Hanging Garden" of walkways, ropes, and high-rise nests.
* **Atmosphere:** Highly communal, protective, and wary of outsiders.
