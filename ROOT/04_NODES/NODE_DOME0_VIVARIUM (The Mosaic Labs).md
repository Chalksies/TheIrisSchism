# SUB_NODE_PROFILE: VIVARIUM_LABS
**Location:** OASIS-01, Sub-Level 4
**Controller:** [[SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]]
**Status:** RESTRICTED / EXPERIMENTAL

---

## 1. Purpose
A massive underground research complex dedicated to **Project Mosaic**. Here, the Keeper splices human DNA with [[HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]]-immune animal markers to create hybrid species capable of surviving the surface.

## 2. The Habitats ("The Sets")
The labs are divided into massive, dome-like enclosures that simulate different biomes. The subjects inside are often unaware they are underground.

## 3. The Dark Secret
The walls are one-way mirrors. Thousands of drones watch the hybrids 24/7, treating their lives, loves, and wars as a "Social Simulation" to understand the human soul.
