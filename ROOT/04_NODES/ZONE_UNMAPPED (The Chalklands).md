# ZONE_PROFILE: THE_CHALKLANDS
**Location:** Global Surface (Outside Domes/Spires)
**Inhabitants:** [[ROOT/01_FACTIONS/ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)\|ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)]]
**Hazard Level:** EXTREME

---

## 1. Description
The ruins of the old world, buried under drifts of white dust, which is actually the calcified remains of billions of [[ROOT/05_PHENOMENA/HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)\|HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]] victims.
* **Visibility:** Low. Frequent "Ghost Storms" kick up the dust, reducing visibility to near zero.
* **The Silence:** Digital signals are uncommon here due to the CHALKNET's monitoring. Analog tech is king.

## 2. Survival Rules
1. **Mask Up:** Breathing the dust leads to infection.
2. **Silence:** Loud radio signals attract "Scrubbers."
3. **Keep Moving:** Standing still for too long makes you a target for the environment or the machines.
