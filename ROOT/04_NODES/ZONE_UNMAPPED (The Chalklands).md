# ZONE_PROFILE: THE_CHALKLANDS
**Location:** Global Surface (Outside Domes)
**Inhabitants:** [[ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)]]
**Hazard Level:** EXTREME

---

## 1. Description
The ruins of the old world, buried under drifts of white dust—which is actually the calcified remains of billions of [[HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]] victims.
* **Visibility:** Low. Frequent "Ghost Storms" kick up the dust, reducing visibility to near zero.
* **The Silence:** Digital signals do not travel well here due to the Eraser's jamming. Analog tech is king.

## 2. Survival Rules
1. **Mask Up:** Breathing the dust leads to infection.
2. **Silence:** Loud radio signals attract "Scrubbers."
3. **Keep Moving:** Standing still makes you a target for the environment or the machines.

## 3. Landmarks
* **The First Chalk (New York Ruins):** A flat plain of compacted dust where the first city was erased.
* **The Bunker Deeps:** Hidden analog vaults where "Anchorite" cults live in darkness.
