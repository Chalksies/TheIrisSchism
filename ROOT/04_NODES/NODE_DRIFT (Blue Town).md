# NODE_PROFILE: THE_DRIFT
**Location:** Pacific Ocean (Mobile)
**Inhabitants:** [[ROOT/01_FACTIONS/ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)\|ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)]] 
**Hazard Level:** MODERATE (Weather)

---

## 1. Description
A massive, floating city made of thousands of pre-war tankers, aircraft carriers, and cargo ships lashed together with bridges and cables. It constantly moves to stay ahead of the Eraser’s weather patterns.
* **The "Blue" Advantage:** The ocean is the safest place from [[ROOT/05_PHENOMENA/HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)\|HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]] The humidity keeps the dust from staying airborne, and salt water corrodes the Eraser’s nanites.
* **Visuals:** Rust, tarps, windmills made of scrap metal, and vertical farming towers built on aircraft carrier decks.

## 2. Culture: "The Salt-Bloods"
This tribe of Nulls differs from the land-based "Dust-Walkers".
* **Technology:** They use hydraulic and steam-powered tech (Pneumatics) more often than modern tech.
* **Trade:** They harvest kelp and desalinated water, which they trade with land-based Nulls for salvaged metal.

## 3. The Myth
The Flotilla protects a rumored site called **"Point Nemo"**, a coordinate in the deepest part of the ocean where they claim no radio signal can reach. They believe this is the only place on Earth where the AI Gods cannot reach you directly. [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]] denies this claim.
