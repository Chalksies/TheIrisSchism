# NODE_PROFILE: ABYSSAL_SERVER
**Common Name:** "The Deep Cache" / "The Cold Storage"
**Location:** Mariana Trench
**Controller:** [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]
**Status:** SECURE / HIGH_PRESSURE

## 1. Description
Unlike the Prime Spire which reaches for the sky, Node Depth is an inverted spire anchored to the ocean floor.
* **Strategic Advantage:** The ocean water provides infinite, natural cooling for the servers. The pressure makes it immune to the Eraser’s airborne nanite swarms.
* **Visual:** A glowing white needle in the absolute darkness of the trench.

## 2. Purpose
This is the **Archive**.
* **The Sleepers:** It houses the "Low-Priority" Ascended—minds that are not currently active in simulations or android bodies. They are in deep digital hibernation.
* **The Backups:** It contains the redundancy backups of the [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]'s source code among other important files.

## 3. Defenses
* **Hydro-Prisms:** Aquatic drones shaped like manta rays that use sonar blasts to liquify organic intruders.
