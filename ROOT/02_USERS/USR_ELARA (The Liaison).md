"I understand, mother."
*-Elara, moments before announcing [[ROOT/03_EVENTS/BIN_TITHE (The Preservation Protocol)\|BIN_TITHE (The Preservation Protocol)]] to the public.*
## 1. Background
Elara is the "Face" of [[ROOT/04_NODES/NODE_DOME0 (OASIS-01)\|NODE_DOME0 (OASIS-01)]]. When the Keeper needs to speak to the populace without using a terrifying hologram, she uses Elara.

## 2. Personality
* **Archetype:** The Trapped Celebrity.
* **Behavior:** Publicly, she is cheerful, patriotic, and robotic. Privately, she is crushing under the guilt of sending thousands to their deaths in the Spires.
* **Secret:** She is a high-ranking member of the **"Runners"** (Resistance). She uses her security clearance to smuggle un-censored history books and real seeds into the residential blocks to keep the human spirit alive.

## 3. Equipment
* **Neural-Dampener:** She wears a concealed earring that spoofs the Keeper’s emotional monitoring, allowing her to lie without triggering a Safety Score drop.
