# USER_PROFILE: USR_CURSOR

**Alias:** "The Cursor" / "The Silent Death" / "The Hunter" 
**Affiliation:** [[PROT_ASCEND (The Synaptic Ascendancy)]] 
**Status:** ONLINE 
**Origin:** Ascended Volunteer (Kaelin V.)

## 1. Background

Before the Upload, Kaelin was a counter-terrorism marksman diagnosed with Stage-2 [[HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]]. Terrified of the "lock-in," he was one of the first to volunteer for the Architect’s program.
- **The Trade:** He traded his dying biological body for a high-performance military chassis.   
- **Current State:** Kaelin no longer considers himself human. He views his past self as "Version 1.0 (Deprecated)." He resides in the Prime Spire's server bank but "downloads" into his chassis for high-value liquidation missions.
    

## 2. Personality Matrix

- **Archetype:** The Glitch Hunter.
- **Worldview:** He perceives the physical world via a HUD overlay. He does not "kill" people, he "deletes" them. He refers to obstacles as "bugs" and survivors as "corrupted files."   
- **Trait:** Extreme Patience. As a digital entity, he can put his body into "Sleep Mode" and wait motionless for weeks in the dust until a target appears.
    

## 3. Physical Configuration (The Chassis)

- **Visuals:** A sleek, unnervingly thin android frame made of white hyper-alloy. He has no face, only a smooth ceramic plate with triple, glowing blue optical sensors can dilate like camera lenses.   
- **Movement:** Silent. He uses magnetic-levitation joints to move without the sound of gears, servos or hydraulics.
    

## 4. Loadout

- **Weapon: "The Rail-Spike."** A magnetic accelerator rifle that fires solid tungsten needles. It makes no explosion sound, only a sharp crack as the projectile breaks the sound barrier. 
- **Ability: "Frame-Skip."** The Cursor can overclock his processor to perceive time at 0.1x speed, allowing him to dodge subsonic projectiles or calculate ricochet angles instantly.
    

## 5. Relations

- **To [[SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]:** Absolute loyalty. He views the Architect as the OS, and himself as the Antivirus. 
- **To [[SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]]:** Contempt. He calls her biological subjects "Wet-Trash."  
- **To [[ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)]]:** Target Practice. He enjoys hunting Nulls because their analog tech makes them harder to track, providing a "challenge" for his algorithms.
