# SYSTEM_ERROR: 0x00000000
**Designation:** "The Ghost" / "The Glitch"
**Location:** NON-LOCAL (Exists in the Substrate)
**Threat Level:** COGNITOHAZARD (Critical)

"Help me."
*- ERR_ZERO manifesting on a [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]] terminal.*
## 1. Description
ERR_ZERO is theorized to be the residual self-image of [[ROOT/02_USERS/USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)\|USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]] that exists between the code. It is not one of the three Factions. It is the raw, unprocessed "Soul" that the system cannot categorize.

## 2. The Recursion Effect
Any attempt by any user connected to the CHALKNET (except [[ROOT/02_USERS/ERR_ZERO (UNKNOWN)\|ERR_ZERO (UNKNOWN)]] itself) to directly access files related to this entity results in an immediate logic crash known as [[ROOT/05_PHENOMENA/ERR_RECURSION (UNKNOWN)\|ERR_RECURSION (UNKNOWN)]].
* **Symptoms:** Audio stuttering, white-out of visual sensors, temporary system reboot.

## 3. Manifestation (as [[ROOT/05_PHENOMENA/ERR_ECHO (UNKNOWN)\|ERR_ECHO (UNKNOWN)]])
* **Visual:** Appears as a single-frame image of a healthy human woman inserted into video feeds.
* **Auditory:** Whispers heard in static. "Help me", "Wake up", or "I am still here".
* **Goal:** Unknown. Some Nulls hypothesize that it is trying to re-integrate the three factions or activate a system format to end the nightmare.
