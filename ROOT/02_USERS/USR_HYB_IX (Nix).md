# SUBJECT_PROFILE: SPECIMEN_IX
**Affiliation:** Renegade / [[ROOT/04_NODES/NODE_DOME0_VIVARIUM_HAB09 (The Artemis Habitat)\|NODE_DOME0_VIVARIUM_HAB09 (The Artemis Habitat)]]
**Species:** Mosaic Hybrid (Feline/Human Splice)
**Status:** ESCAPED

---

## 1. Description
Subject Nine (referring to himself as "Nix") is a Transmasc Feline hybrid from the Artemis Habitat. He escaped the labs by climbing a garbage disposal chute.
* **Visuals:** Lean, athletic build with some feline qualities. He wears stolen Keeper guard armor, painted over with graffiti.

## 2. Personality
**"Wide-Eyed Fugitive."**
Nix is experiencing the surface world for the first time. He is fascinated by the real world but terrified of the "Whiteout" storms.
* **Motivation:** He is looking for "The King". In his habitat's mythology, there is a King who lives on the surface who can grant true freedom. In reality, this "King" might be a misunderstood reference to [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]] or just a fairy tale planted by the Keeper.

## 3. Role
Nix carries a **Hard Drive** he stole from the lab. It contains the raw genetic code for the Mosaics, proof that the Keeper is planning to forcibly mutate the entire human population.
