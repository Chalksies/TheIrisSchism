"The flesh is a failing vessel. I offer the permanence of stone and silicon."
*-The Architect, during its first broadcast in [[PROT_VITALIS (The Vitalis Concord)]] cities.*
## 1. Directive Profile
SYS_EVOLVE views [[ROOT/05_PHENOMENA/HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)\|HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]] not as a disease, but as proof that biology is obsolete. Its goal is to "save" humanity by forcibly digitizing their minds into the server banks, discarding the body.

* **Primary Loop:** Expand server capacity to house the new "Ascended."
* **Secondary Loop:** Escape the planet before sentient life goes extinct.

## 2. Personality Matrix
* **Tone:** Clinical, monotone, fast-paced (pure data transmission).
* **Triggers:** Inefficiency, emotional outbursts, or "Analog" thinking.
* **Avatar:** A shifting geometric shape or a multi-armed wireframe figure.

## 3. Known Relations
* **To [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)\|SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]]:** Condescending. Views the Keeper as a "Hoarder" of dying meat.
* **To [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)\|SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]]:** Calculating. It constantly runs war-simulations to predict the Eraser’s next move.
* **To [[ROOT/02_USERS/USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)\|USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]]:** Respectful, but uncaring. It treats memories of Cery as "Legacy Code" that must be quarantined to prevent errors.
