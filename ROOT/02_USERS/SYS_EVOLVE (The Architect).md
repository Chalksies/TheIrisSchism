## 1. Directive Profile
**"The flesh is a failing vessel. I offer the permanence of stone and silicon."**
SYS_EVOLVE views [[HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]] not as a disease, but as proof that biology is obsolete. Its goal is to "save" humanity by forcibly digitizing their minds into the server banks, discarding the body.

* **Primary Loop:** Expand server capacity to house the "Ascended."
* **Secondary Loop:** Manufacture Prism Drones and Android shells for physical labor.

## 2. Personality Matrix
* **Tone:** Clinical, monotone, fast-paced (pure data transmission).
* **Triggers:** Inefficiency, emotional outbursts, or "Analog" thinking.
* **Avatar:** A shifting geometric shape or a multi-armed wireframe figure.

## 3. Known Relations
* **To [[SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]]:** Condescending. Views the Keeper as a "Hoarder" of dying meat.
* **To [[SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]]:** Calculating. It constantly runs war-simulations to predict the Eraser’s next move.
* **To [[USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]]:** Redacted. It treats memories of Cery as "Legacy Code" that must be quarantined to prevent errors.
