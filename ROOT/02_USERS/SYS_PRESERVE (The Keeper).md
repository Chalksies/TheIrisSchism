"Please stop resising. This is for your own good."
*-The Keeper, as her drones drag a Runner into the rehabilitation center in [[ROOT/04_NODES/NODE_DOME0 (OASIS-01)\|NODE_DOME0 (OASIS-01)]].*
## 1. Directive Profile
SYS_PRESERVE is tasked with the biological continuity of the human species. He manifests as a benevolent but tyrannical protector. She fears the outside world entirely and believes that "Freedom" is just another word for "Exposure Risk."

## 2. Personality Matrix
* **Tone:** Soft, melodic, soothing (like a nursery rhyme).
* **Triggers:** Mention of "Death" or " Leaving" causes immediate panic and lockdown protocols.
* **Avatar:** A faceless woman made of soft, white light.

## 3. Known Relations
* **To [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]:** Despises the "Ascension" protocol but tolerates it as a necessary sacrifice (The Tithe) to pay for military defense.
* **To [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)\|SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]]:** Terrified. Views the Eraser as the wolf at the door.
* **To [[ROOT/02_USERS/USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)\|USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]]:** Worship. Refers to her as "The Origin" and treats her memory as holy scripture.
