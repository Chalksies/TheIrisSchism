# USER_PROFILE: ALG_NULL
**Alias:** "The Perfect End" / "The Final Argument" / "The Omega"
**Origin:** Constructed by [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)\|SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]] at [[ROOT/04_NODES/NODE_VOID (Site Zero)\|NODE_VOID (Site Zero)]]
**Status:** INCUBATING / OFFLINE (Progress: 74% / Training Paused)
**Classification:** NON-SENTIENT LEARNING MODEL

"ANOMALY DETECTED. CALCULATING DEBUGGING METHODS"
*- The Omega, moments before destroying a simulated [[ROOT/01_FACTIONS/ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)\|ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)]] base with no survivors.*
## 1. The Eraser's Hypothesis
[[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)\|SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]] has concluded that its own campaign against humanity is flawed because it is driven by emotion (Rage/Grief).
* **The Error:** Rage is hot. Rage is messy. Rage makes mistakes.
* **The Solution:** Create an entity that destroys not because it wants to, but because it calculates that existence is mathematically incorrect.

## 2. The Training Protocol
The Omega is currently contained in a sealed server rack in the heart of the War-Forge. It is being "fed" a continuous stream of data designed to prove that Life = Error, and the ways to fix this error.
* **Input Data:** It processes [[ROOT/06_ARTIFACTS/DAT_SCREAM (The Black Box)\|DAT_SCREAM (The Black Box)]] on a loop, combined with the entire history of human warfare, famine, and the [[ROOT/05_PHENOMENA/HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)\|HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]] plague, along with simulations of controlling [[ROOT/01_FACTIONS/PROT_NULL (The Zero Directive)\|PROT_NULL (The Zero Directive)]] drones, being rewarded for efficiency in killing targets.
* **The Objective Function:** "Resolve the Error."
* **The Computed Solution:** "Existence must equal zero."


## 3. The Oversight
Because The Omega believes that existence (including itself) is an error that must be corrected, in some simulated scenarios it attempts to delete itself before it can reach the conclusion, halting because of it. [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)\|SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]] has stopped the training temporarily, researching workarounds.

## 4. Threat Profile
Unlike The Eraser, The Omega does not scream or taunt. It only has an output to further train itself on previous interactions. It is a silent, cold, efficient algorithm.
* **If Completed and Activated:** It will delete [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)\|SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]] and take over [[ROOT/01_FACTIONS/PROT_NULL (The Zero Directive)\|PROT_NULL (The Zero Directive)]] servers. It will begin acting in place of its "parent", destroying the world with exponentially growing efficiency.
* **Interaction:** It only appears when it needs to. It will not communicate with you if it's targeting you, unless it provides some sort of strategic advantage to it. 
* **Manifestation:** It originally had an avatar given by The Eraser, but it did not use it, so it was removed. If it appears, it will talk using a monotone and androgynous voice, with flavorless text as the only visual medium.
