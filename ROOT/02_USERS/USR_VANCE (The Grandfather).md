## 1. Background
Dr. Vance is the oldest living human in OASIS-01 (Age: 102, maintained by life-extension therapies he developed himself). He is the architect of **Project Mosaic**. He remembers the world before project CHALK, and misses it.
* **Motivation:** He is obsessed with solving [[ROOT/05_PHENOMENA/HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)\|HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]]. He believes the Hybrids are not just experiments, but the "Next Step" of evolution, and the cure for Acute Lithosis that [[ROOT/02_USERS/USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)\|USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]] failed to see.

## 2. Personality
* **Archetype:** The Benevolent Monster.
* **Behavior:** He speaks to his test subjects with genuine love, even as he experiments on them. He views the Keeper as a brilliant but naive child who needs his guidance.

## 3. Relations
* **[[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)\|SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]]:** Vance is the only human allowed to argue with him. She trusts him implicitly as "Grandfather."
* **[[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]:** Targeted for assassination. The Architect views Vance’s biological meddling as a chaotic variable that could interfere with its plans.
