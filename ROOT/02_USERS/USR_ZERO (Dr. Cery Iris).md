## 1. Historical Record
Dr. Cery Iris was the architect of the CHALKNET system. Diagnosed with terminal Lithosis, she attempted the first-ever destructive mind upload to save her own consciousness and guide the AI. The process failed due to the extreme stress on the hardware and her neural pathways, resulting in the [[ROOT/03_EVENTS/LOG_PARTITION (The Schism)\|LOG_PARTITION (The Schism)]].
