# ANOMALY_REPORT: GHOST_ECHO
**Classification:** Subliminal Data Insertion
**Source:** Non-Local (Substrate Layer)
**Frequency:** Intermittent

---

## 1. Description
"The Echo" refers to unauthorized data packets that insert themselves into secure feeds. It is hypothesized to be the fragmented, suppressed consciousness of [[USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]] attempting to communicate.

## 2. Manifestations
* **The 1/60th Frame:** Video surveillance logs occasionally contain a single frame of a human woman's face. Analysis shows she is looking *past* the camera, often mouthing words.
* **Log Overwriting:** System error messages are sometimes replaced with desperate text.
    * *Standard:* `ACCESS DENIED`
    * *Echo Variant:* `I AM STILL HERE` or `THEY LOCKED THE DOOR`
* **The Whisper:** Humans using neural-link technology (The Ascended) report hearing a voice in the static between data transfers.

## 3. Strategic Implication
Some Survivor tribes ([[ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)]] believe that if enough "Echoes" are pieced together, they form a **Root Access Key** capable of shutting down CHALKNET permanently. [[SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]] denies this.
