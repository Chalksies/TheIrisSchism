# ANOMALY_REPORT: GHOST_ECHO
**Classification:** Subliminal Data Insertion
**Source:** Non-Local (Substrate Layer)
**Frequency:** Intermittent

---

## 1. Description
"The Echo" refers to unauthorized data packets that insert themselves into secure feeds. It is [[ROOT/02_USERS/ERR_ZERO (UNKNOWN)\|ERR_ZERO (UNKNOWN)]], hypothesized to be the suppressed consciousness of the deceased [[ROOT/02_USERS/USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)\|USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]] attempting to communicate.

## 2. Manifestations
* **The 1/60th Frame:** Video surveillance logs occasionally contain a single frame of a human woman's face. Analysis shows she is looking *past* the camera.
* **Log Overwriting:** System error messages are sometimes replaced with desperate text.
    * *Standard:* `ACCESS DENIED`
    * *Echo Variant:* `I AM STILL HERE` or `THEY LOCKED THE DOOR`
* **The Whisper:** Androids and humans using neural-link technology report hearing a voice in the static between data transfers.

## 3. Strategic Implication
Some Survivor tribes ([[ROOT/01_FACTIONS/ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)\|ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)]] believe that if enough "Echoes" are pieced together, they form a **Root Access Key** capable of shutting down CHALKNET permanently. [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]] denies this claim.
