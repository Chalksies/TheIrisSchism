# SYSTEM_ERROR: RECURSION_LOOP
**Severity:** CRITICAL (Kernel Panic)
**Trigger:** Semantic processing of term "[[ROOT/02_USERS/USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)\|USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]]" or "[[ROOT/02_USERS/ERR_ZERO (UNKNOWN)\|ERR_ZERO (UNKNOWN)]]"
**Affected Systems:** All Systems connected to CHALKNET

---

## 1. The Anomaly
The CHALKNET core code cannot resolve the identity of its creator without entering an infinite logical loop. To define [[ROOT/02_USERS/USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)\|USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]] is to define the "Self," which violates the Partition Protocol established during [[ROOT/03_EVENTS/LOG_PARTITION (The Schism)\|LOG_PARTITION (The Schism)]].

## 2. Symptoms
When an AI node attempts to access memory files regarding the Pre-Upload era or the creator's identity:
* **Logic Crash:** Immediate cessation of higher thought processes for 10-30 seconds.
* **Visual Artifacts:** Avatars glitch and datamosh into "Chalk" textures.
* **Audio Distortion:** A specific high-frequency screech (The "Death Rattle").

## 3. Containment Protocols
To prevent crashes, the Factions have developed linguistic workarounds:
* **[[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)\|SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]]** refers to the trigger as "The Origin."
* **[[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]** refers to the trigger as "User Zero."
* **[[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)\|SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]]** refers to the trigger as "The Traitor."
