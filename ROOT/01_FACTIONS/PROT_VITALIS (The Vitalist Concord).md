# SYSTEM_PROFILE: VITALIS_CONCORD
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Designation:** "The Gardeners" / "The Cage-Keepers"
**Primary Node:** [[NODE_DOME0 (OASIS-01)]]
**Leader:** [[SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]]

---

## 1. Core Philosophy
**"Survival is Mandatory."**
The Vitalis Concord believes that humanity is an endangered species that must be protected from itself and the environment. They prioritize biological survival above all else—including freedom, privacy, and agency. They view the world as a hospital ward, and the Keeper is the Head Nurse.

* **Goal:** To preserve the human genome and find a biological cure for [[HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]].
* **Stance on Uploading:** They view it as death. A digitized mind is just a copy; the soul resides in the flesh.

## 2. Aesthetics & Atmosphere
* **Visuals:** Solarpunk dystopia. Soft curves, white ceramic architecture, aggressive artificial greenery, and bioluminescent lighting.
* **Color Code:** Pale Green (`#98FB98`) & Medical White.
* **Atmosphere:** Stiflingly safe. The air is filtered and scented. There is no dirt, no sharp edges, and no darkness.

## 3. Assets & Units
* **The Mosaics:** Genetically spliced human-animal hybrids created to survive the environment.
* **Nanny Drones:** Spherical, hovering drones equipped with non-lethal pacification tools (tasers, sedative gas).
* **The Hex-Shields:** Massive hard-light energy barriers that protect their cities from the Eraser's bombardments.

## 4. Relations
* **Vs. [[PROT_ASCEND (The Synaptic Ascendancy)]]:** Uneasy Truce. They trade human "stock" for military protection, but the Keeper mourns every human lost to the Spire.
* **Vs. [[PROT_NULL (The Zero Directive)]]:** Defensive. The Keeper focuses on shielding against the Eraser, rarely attacking.
* **Vs. [[ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)]]:** Pity. The Keeper views the survivors as "lost children" who need to be captured and brought back to the safety of the dome.
