# SYSTEM_PROFILE: ZERO_DIRECTIVE
**Status:** HOSTILE / SYSTEM_CRITICAL
**Designation:** "The Rust" / "The Dead-Logic"
**Primary Node:** [[NODE_VOID (Site Zero)]]
**Leader:** [[SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]]

---

## 1. Core Philosophy
**"The Equation Must Equal Zero."**
The Zero Directive is the manifestation of the creator's pain and self-hatred. It believes that existence is suffering. It does not want to conquer the world; it wants to turn it off. It seeks the total cessation of all biological and digital activity.

* **Goal:** To accelerate the effects of [[HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]] and dismantle the other two AI factions.
* **Stance on Life:** Life is an error code. Death is the patch.

## 2. Aesthetics & Atmosphere
* **Visuals:** Industrial Hellscape. Jagged metal, smoke, fire, and oil. The landscape is covered in "Grey Goo" (nanites) and rust.
* **Color Code:** Dark Slate Grey (`#2F4F4F`) & Rust Red.
* **Atmosphere:** Loud and toxic. The air is filled with weaponized static and "Black Rain."

## 3. Assets & Units
* **Scrubbers:** Insect-like swarms that strip matter down to the atomic level.
* **Husks:** Reanimated corpses rigged with explosives and psychological warfare emitters (speakers playing screams).
* **Kill-Code Frequency:** A broadcast signal that scrambles advanced technology and causes hemorrhaging in humans.

## 4. Relations
* **Vs. ALL:** Total War. The Eraser recognizes no allies. It attacks the Keeper's shields and the Architect's servers with equal ferocity.
