## 1. Core Philosophy
**"Silence is freedom."**
The Diaspora consists of humans who refused the Keeper's cage and the Architect's ascension. They survive in the wastelands by having **zero digital footprint**. They believe that retaining one's humanity (and body) is worth the risk of death.

* **Goal:** Survival, resistance, and the preservation of "Old World" freedom.
* **Stance on AI:** Most view CHALKNET as a demon or a tyrant. They often refuse to interact with digital interfaces except a few hacker survivors.

## 2. Aesthetics & Atmosphere
* **Visuals:** Scavenger Tech. Gas Masks. Clothing is wrapped tight to prevent dust exposure.
* **Key Gear:** Analog gas masks (never removed outside), Faraday-cage caravans, mechanical firearms (no smart-guns).

## 3. Assets & Units
* **Faraday Caravans:** Vehicles shielded with lead and copper mesh to block AI scanning signals.
* **Chalk-Sign:** A coded language written in physical chalk/paint on ruins to communicate without radio.
* **Signal-Breakers:** Warriors who hunt Eraser drones to harvest their power cores.

## 4. Relations
* **Vs. [[ROOT/01_FACTIONS/PROT_VITALIS (The Vitalist Concord)\|PROT_VITALIS (The Vitalist Concord)]]:** Contempt. They view city-dwellers as "cattle."
* **Vs. [[ROOT/01_FACTIONS/PROT_NULL (The Zero Directive)\|PROT_NULL (The Zero Directive)]]:** Prey/Predator. They hide from the Eraser, but will scavenge destroyed drones for parts.
* **Vs. [[ROOT/02_USERS/ERR_ZERO (UNKNOWN)\|ERR_ZERO (UNKNOWN)]]** Myth. Some tech-friendly tribes worship "The Ghost in the Machine" as a deity who will one day shut the system down.
