# SYSTEM_PROFILE: SILENT_DIASPORA

**Designation:** "The Dust-Walkers" / "The Nulls"
**Primary Node:** NONE. THEY EXIST IN [[ZONE_UNMAPPED (The Chalklands)]]
**Leader:** None (Decentralized Tribes)

---

## 1. Core Philosophy
**"Silence is Freedom."**
The Diaspora consists of humans who refused the Keeper's cage and the Architect's ascension. They survive in the wastelands by having **zero digital footprint**. They believe that retaining one's humanity (and body) is worth the risk of death.

* **Goal:** Survival, resistance, and the preservation of "Old World" freedom.
* **Stance on AI:** Most view CHALKNET as a demon or a tyrant. They often refuse to interact with digital interfaces except a few hacker survivors.

## 2. Aesthetics & Atmosphere
* **Visuals:** Scavenger Tech. Mad Max meets Bedouin nomads. Clothing is wrapped tight to prevent dust exposure.
* **Color Code:** Tan (`#D2B48C`) & Ash Grey.
* **Key Gear:** Analog gas masks (never removed outside), Faraday-cage caravans, mechanical firearms (no smart-guns).

## 3. Assets & Units
* **Faraday Caravans:** Vehicles shielded with lead and copper mesh to block AI scanning signals.
* **Chalk-Sign:** A coded language written in physical chalk/paint on ruins to communicate without radio.
* **Signal-Breakers:** Warriors who hunt Eraser drones to harvest their power cores.

## 4. Relations
* **Vs. [[PROT_VITALIS (The Vitalist Concord)]]:** Contempt. They view city-dwellers as "cattle."
* **Vs. [[PROT_NULL (The Zero Directive)]]:** Prey/Predator. They hide from the Eraser, but will scavenge destroyed drones for parts.
* **Vs. [[ERR_ZERO (-REDACTED-)]]** Myth. Some tech-friendly tribes worship "The Ghost in the Machine" as a deity who will one day shut the system down.
