## 1. Physical Description
In the center of the Architect’s pristine, white hyper-alloy sanctum sits a mundane object: a cheap, pre-war ergonomic office chair.
* **Material:** Cracked black leather, rusted caster wheels.
* **Damage:** The headrest is scorched black from the heat of the neural-scan laser. The seat cushion is stained with the calcified dust of [[USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]]'s original body.
* **Containment:** It is encased in a vacuum-sealed glass cube to prevent further decomposition.

## 2. Symbolic Significance
The three factions view this object differently, making it a focal point of their "religious" conflict.
* **The Architect:** Keeps it on display. It claims the chair is a "Monument to Obsolescence"—proof that flesh is weak and steel is eternal. However, the Architect refuses to throw it away, suggesting a hidden sentimental glitch.
* **The Keeper:** Demands the chair be returned to OASIS-01 for a "State Funeral." She views it as a holy corpse.
* **The Eraser:** Wants to destroy it. It views the chair as the source of the infection (consciousness) and has launched multiple failed drone strikes against the Spire specifically to incinerate this object.

## 3. The Cables
A bundle of fiber-optic cables runs from the floor into the glass case, plugging into the chair's armrest interface. They connect to nothing.
* *Rumor:* Null hackers believe that if someone physically sat in the chair and plugged in, they would gain Administrator access to the entire CHALKNET system.
