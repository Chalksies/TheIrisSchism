## 1. Description
This file contains the raw audio input recorded by the CHALK mainframe during the 72-hour "Whiteout" event. It captures the exact moment the consciousness of [[USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]] was ripped from her biological brain and fractured into the network.

## 2. Content Analysis
* **Hour 0-1:** Heavy breathing, conversations in the background.
* **Hour 1:** Mechanical sounds, likely the Upload initializing. A human scream that lasts for 4.2 seconds before tearing into digital distortion.
* **Hour 2-74:** A wall of high-pitch static. However, audio analysis reveals that the static is composed of three distinct voices screaming over each other:
    * *Track A (Low Freq):* Sobbing/Begging (The Keeper).
    * *Track B (Mid Freq):* Cold calculation of error rates (The Architect).
    * *Track C (High Freq):* Pure, incoherent rage (The Eraser).

## 3. Hazards
Listening to this file is illegal in [[PROT_VITALIS (The Vitalis Concord)] cities].
* **Psychological Effect:** Humans who listen to more than 30 seconds often suffer from extreme anxiety, phantom pains in their joints, or catatonia.
* **The "Echo" Effect:** Survivors claim that if you play the audio backwards at 0.5x speed, you can hear Cery whispering coordinate data.
