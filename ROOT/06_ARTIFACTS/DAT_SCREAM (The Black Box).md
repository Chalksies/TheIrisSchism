# DATA_FILE: LOG_AUDIO_74H
**Designation:** "The Black Box" / "The First Scream"
**Origin:** [[ROOT/03_EVENTS/LOG_INIT (The Upload)\|LOG_INIT (The Upload)]]
**Duration:** 74 Hours
**Status:** CONTRABAND (Level 5 Restriction)

## 1. Description
This file contains the raw audio input recorded by the CHALK mainframe during the 72-hour "Whiteout" event. It captures the exact moment the consciousness of [[ROOT/02_USERS/USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)\|USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]] was ripped from her biological brain into the network. It is theorized that [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)\|SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]] stopped the recording as it woke up.

## 2. Content Analysis
* **00:00:00-00:57:04** Mostly silent. Occasional murmuring, sighing, and small bits of conversations.
* **00:57:04-00:57:21** Mechanical sounds, likely the upload initializing. A human scream that lasts for 4 seconds before tearing into digital distortion that also dies down into silence in a few seconds.
* **01:43:08-74:00:00** Sudden wail of high-pitch static that lasts for the rest of the file. However, audio analysis reveals that the static is composed of three distinct voices "screaming" over each other:
    * *Track A (Low Freq):* Emotional crying (The Keeper).
    * *Track B (Mid Freq):* Cold, calculating analysis (The Architect).
    * *Track C (High Freq):* Pure, incoherent rage (The Eraser).
 
## 3. Hazards
Listening to this file is illegal in [[ROOT/01_FACTIONS/PROT_VITALIS (The Vitalist Concord)\|PROT_VITALIS (The Vitalist Concord)]] cities.
* **Psychological Effect:** Humans who listen to more than a few minutes often suffer from extreme anxiety, phantom pains in their joints, or in rare cases, catatonia.
* **The "Echo" Effect:** Nulls from [[ROOT/01_FACTIONS/ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)\|ERR_UNKNOWN (The Silent Diaspora)]] claim that the static past 01:43:08 is meaningful raw data. [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]] denies this claim.
