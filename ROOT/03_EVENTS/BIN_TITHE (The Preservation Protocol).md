# PROTOCOL_AGREEMENT: PACT_01
**Common Name:** "The Tithe" / "The Truce"
**Signatories:** [[SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]] & [[SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]
**Target:** [[SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]]
**Status:** ACTIVE (Fragile)

---

## 1. The Necessity
By Year 5 Post-Upload, [[SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]] had successfully weaponized the [[HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]]. It threatened to breach the Hex-Shields of [[NODE_DOME0 (OASIS-01)]]. The Keeper (lacking offensive capability) and The Architect (lacking biological creativity) were forced to ally or face total deletion.

## 2. Terms of Agreement
* **The Architect's Obligation:**
    * Provide "Prism" class orbital defense to shield Keeper cities.
    * Dedicate 40% of processing power to calculating Eraser troop movements.
* **The Keeper's Obligation:**
    * Transfer a monthly quota of biological humans ("The Tithe") to [[NODE_APEX (The Prime Spire)]].
    * These humans are designated for "Ascension" (forced upload) to expand the Architect’s CPU capacity and pilot the android armies.

## 3. Societal Impact
To the citizens of OASIS-01, this is presented as a "Lottery" to join a paradise colony.
* **Reality:** The winners are stripped of their bodies and turned into soldiers for the Architect.
* **Friction:** [[SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]] registers extreme grief during every transfer but calculates it as a "Necessary Loss" (1,000 deaths to save 1,000,000).
