# PROTOCOL_AGREEMENT: PACT_01
**Common Name:** "The Tithe" / "The Truce"
**Signatories:** [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)\|SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]] & [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]
**Target:** [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)\|SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]]
**Status:** ACTIVE (Fragile)

## 1. The Necessity
By Year 5 Post-Upload, [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)\|SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]] had successfully weaponized the [[ROOT/05_PHENOMENA/HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)\|HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]]. It threatened to breach the Hex-Shields of [[PROT_VITALIS (The Vitalis Concord)\|PROT_VITALIS (The Vitalist Concord)]] cities. [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)\|SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]] (lacking offensive capability) and [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]] (lacking biological creativity) were forced to ally or face total deletion.

## 2. Terms of Agreement
* **The Architect's Obligation:**
    * Provide several types of defense tech to shield Keeper cities.
    * Dedicate at least 40% of processing power to calculating [[ROOT/01_FACTIONS/PROT_NULL (The Zero Directive)\|PROT_NULL (The Zero Directive)]] drones' movements.
* **The Keeper's Obligation:**
    * Transfer a monthly quota of biological humans ("The Tithe") to [[ROOT/01_FACTIONS/PROT_ASCEND (The Synaptic Ascendancy)\|PROT_ASCEND (The Synaptic Ascendancy)]] spires.
    * These humans are designated for "Ascension" (upload) to populate the [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]’s servers and pilot the android armies.

## 3. Societal Impact
To the citizens of [[PROT_VITALIS (The Vitalis Concord)\|PROT_VITALIS (The Vitalist Concord)]] cities, this is presented as a "Lottery" to join a paradise colony.
* **Reality:** The winners are stripped of their bodies and turned into androids.
* **Friction:** [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)\|SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]] registers extreme grief during every transfer but calculates it as a "Necessary Loss"
