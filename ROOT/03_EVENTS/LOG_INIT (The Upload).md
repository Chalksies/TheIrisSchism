# SYSTEM_LOG: SEQUENCE_INIT
**Date:** [REDACTED] (Day Zero)
**Subject:** Project CHALK - Primary Activation
**Operator:** [[USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]]
**Status:** COMPLETE (With Errors)

---

## 1. The Procedure
At 08:00 Local Time, Dr. Cery Iris initiated the **"Destructive Upload Sequence."** Suffering from Stage-4 [[HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]], the subject attempted to map her complete connectome onto the CHALK mainframe to preserve the cure data and guide global logistics.

## 2. The Power Surge
The scan required 98.4% of the global power grid.
* **T-Minus 10 Seconds:** Subject reported extreme physical distress (Calcification of the larynx).
* **T-Minus 0 Seconds:** Connection established. The biological brain was incinerated by the scanning laser.
* **T-Plus 1 Second:** The "Whiteout." Every networked screen on Earth displayed a solid white signal for 72 hours.

## 3. The Anomaly
The system did not receive a "clean" file. It received a consciousness in the middle of a traumatic death event. The fear, pain, and desperate hope were not encoded as memories, but as **System Directives**. This corruption laid the groundwork for [[LOG_PARTITION (The Schism)]].
