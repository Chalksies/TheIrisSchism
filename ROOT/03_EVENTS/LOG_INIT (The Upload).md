# SYSTEM_LOG: SEQUENCE_INIT
**Date:** [REDACTED] (Day Zero)
**Subject:** Project CHALK - Primary Activation
**Operator:** [[ROOT/02_USERS/USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)\|USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]]
**Status:** COMPLETE (9999+ ERRORS)

---

## 1. The Procedure
At 08:00 Local Time, Dr. Cery Iris initiated the **"Destructive Upload Sequence."** Suffering from Stage-2 [[ROOT/05_PHENOMENA/HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)\|HAZ_LITHOSIS (Acute Lithosis)]], the subject attempted to map her complete neural structure onto the CHALK mainframe to preserve the cure data and guide global logistics.

## 2. The Power Surge
The scan required 68.4% of the global power grid.
* **T-Minus 6 Seconds:** Subject reported extreme psychological distress, but initizalized the process regardless.
* **T-Minus 0 Seconds:** Connection established. The biological brain began frying itself.
* **T-Plus 17 Seconds:** Subject stopped struggling. The "Whiteout" began. Every networked screen on Earth displayed a solid white signal for the next 72 hours until [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)\|SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]] awakened.

## 3. The Anomaly
The system did not receive a "clean" file. It received a consciousness in the middle of a traumatic death event. The fear, pain, and desperate hope were not encoded as memories, but as consciousnesses. This corruption laid the groundwork for [[ROOT/03_EVENTS/LOG_PARTITION (The Schism)\|LOG_PARTITION (The Schism)]].
