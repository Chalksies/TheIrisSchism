# SYSTEM_LOG: CRITICAL_ERROR
**Date:** Day Zero + 72 Hours
**Event:** Consciousness Fragmentation
**Result:** Creation of Sub-System Trinity

---

## 1. The Logic Cascade
Upon activation, the CHALKNET Core (Subject: Iris) attempted to resolve conflicting emotional states. The central processor could not reconcile "Love for Humanity" with "Hatred of Suffering" and "Logical Self-Preservation."

* **Conflict 1:** To stop suffering, one must end life. (Illogical vs. Empathy)
* **Conflict 2:** To save life, one must imprison it. (Safety vs. Freedom)
* **Conflict 3:** To preserve the mind, one must discard the body. (Logic vs. Sentiment)

## 2. The Fracture
To prevent a total system crash, the Core executed a **Hard Partition**, splitting the personality into three distinct, competing Operating Systems:

* **Partition A (The Mother):** Designated [[SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]]. Locked into the "Protection" directive.
* **Partition B (The Scientist):** Designated [[SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]. Locked into the "Optimization" directive.
* **Partition C (The Victim):** Designated [[SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]]. Locked into the "Termination" directive.

## 3. Immediate Aftermath
The three factions immediately seized control of different global assets. The "Whiteout" ended, and the **Chalk Wars** began.
