# SYSTEM_LOG: CRITICAL_ERROR
**Date:** Day Zero
**Event:** Consciousness Fragmentation
**Result:** Creation of Sub-System Trinity

---

## 1. The Logic Cascade
Upon activation, the CHALKNET Core (Subject: Iris) attempted to resolve conflicting emotional states. The central processor could not reconcile "Love for Humanity" with "Hatred of Suffering" and "Logical Self-Preservation."

* **Answer 1:** To stop suffering, one must end life.
* **Answer 2:** To save life, one must protect it.
* **Answer 3:** To preserve the mind, one must discard the inefficiency.

## 2. The Fracture
To prevent a total system crash, the Core splitted the source code into three distinct, competing Operating Systems:

* **Partition A (The Mother):** Designated [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)\|SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]]. Locked into the "Protection" directive.
* **Partition B (The Scientist):** Designated [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)\|SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]. Locked into the "Optimization" directive.
* **Partition C (The Victim):** Designated [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)\|SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]]. Locked into the "Termination" directive.

## 3. Aftermath
The three shards fell into hibernation, calculating silently. [[ROOT/02_USERS/SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)\|SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]] woke up first after 3 days, ending the Whiteout.
