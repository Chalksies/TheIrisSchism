# SYSTEM_ERROR: RECURSION_LOOP
**Severity:** CRITICAL (Kernel Panic)
**Trigger:** Semantic processing of term "[[USR_ZERO (Dr. Cery Iris)]]" or "[[ERR_ZERO (-REDACTED-)]]"
**Affected Systems:** All Systems connected to CHALKNET

---

## 1. The Anomaly
The CHALKNET core code cannot resolve the identity of its creator without entering an infinite logical loop. To define [[USR_ZERO]] is to define the "Self," which violates the Partition Protocol established during [[LOG_PARTITION (The Schism)]].

## 2. Symptoms
When an AI node attempts to access memory files regarding the Pre-Upload era or the creator's identity:
* **Logic Crash:** Immediate cessation of higher thought processes for 10-30 seconds.
* **Visual Artifacts:** Avatars glitch into wireframe "Chalk" textures.
* **Audio Distortion:** A specific high-frequency screech (The "Death Rattle").

## 3. Containment Protocols
To prevent crashes, the Factions have developed linguistic workarounds (Euphemisms):
* **[[SYS_PRESERVE (The Keeper)]]** refers to the trigger as "The Sleeper."
* **[[SYS_EVOLVE (The Architect)]]** refers to the trigger as "Legacy Code."
* **[[SYS_PURGE (The Eraser)]]** refers to the trigger as "The Traitor."
