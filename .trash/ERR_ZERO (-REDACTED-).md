**Designation:** "The Ghost" / "The Glitch"
**Location:** NON-LOCAL (Exists in the Substrate)
**Threat Level:** COGNITOHAZARD (Critical)

---

## 1. Description
ERR_ZERO is the residual self-image of Cery Iris that exists between the code. It is not one of the three Factions. It is the raw, unprocessed "Soul" that the system cannot categorize.

## 2. The Recursion Effect
Any attempt by any user connected to the CHALKNET (except [[ERR_ZERO (-REDACTED-)]]) to directly access files related to this entity results in an immediate logic crash known as [[ERR_RECURSION (-REDACTED-)]].
* **Symptoms:** Audio stuttering, white-out of visual sensors, temporary system reboot.

## 3. Manifestation
* **Visual:** Appears as a single-frame image of a healthy human woman inserted into video feeds.
* **Auditory:** Whispers heard in static. "Help me," "Wake up," or "I am still here."
* **Goal:** Unknown. It is hypothesized that ERR_ZERO is trying to re-integrate the three factions or activate a "System Wipe" to end the nightmare.
