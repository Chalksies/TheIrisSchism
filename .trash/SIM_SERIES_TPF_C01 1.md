# SIMULATION_LOG: SERIES_THE_PALE_FREQUENCY_C01

**Title:** The Analog Breach 
**Type:** Log Reconstruction 
**Location:** [[NODE_DOME0 (OASIS-01)]] - Sector 8 
**Status:** ARCHIVED

## 1. Context Parameters

**Time:** 03:00 Cycle Time (Night). **Setting:** "The Dregs." The lowest level of the residential stacks where the artificial sunlight is dimmest and the "Nanny Drones" rarely patrol. **Subject Profile:** Jax Vane. A "Runner". He specializes in retrieving pre-war tech for collectors.

## 2. Playback Sequence

Light rain (scheduled cleaning cycle) patters against the neon tarp. Jax stands across from a cloaked figure.

**Null:** "Don't scan it. Don't upload it. Keep it off the grid." 
**Jax:** "A cassette tape! I haven't seen one of these outside the museums. What's on it? Music?" 
**Null:** "A location. It started broadcasting on the shortwave band yesterday. The Eraser and The Architect are trying to triangulate it. But we found it before them, somehow." 
**Jax:** "Why give it to me?" 
**Null:** "Because the location is underground. We can't dig without pinpointing the exact place. We need a Dome-dweller with access to the old maps and mining schematics. Just don't upload it."
**Jax:** "Okay, fine. I'll take a look."

They nod to each other and go in seperate directions. Jax walks through the wet streets and enters a small, white, shapeless building that isn't much different than the other ones in the vicinity. He takes off his wet coat, throwing it on the couch as he walks towards a drawer.

He opens the drawer to reveal a bunch of pre-upload tech, including a casette player. He inserts the tape into it, expecting static. Instead, he hears a voice. It is calm, tired, yet stressed.

> "This is Cery. If you are hearing this, the Upload went wrong. The key to the backdoor is at... [Static]... Sector 44, beneath the dust."

He grabs his tablet from the table, opening a map. Suddenly, the lights in the house turn a soft but alarming red.

**PA System:** "Citizen Vane. You are in possession of Class-A Contraband. Please remain stationary. Mother is coming to help you."

Jax shoves the tablet and the player into his bag and scrambles for the gear he borrowed from the Nulls. He knows "Help" means lobotomy. 

**Jax:** "Computer, blow the mag-locks on the ventilation shaft." **Computer:** "That is unsafe, user." 
**Jax:** "Do it!"

The locks blow as Jax puts on a gas mask. He dives into the dark tunnels.

A squad of Nanny Drones float in through the door into the empty house, their tasers charging with a cheerful hum.

**Drone_46:** "Citizen missing."
**Drone_45:** "Household scanning authorized. Task: Identify source of ERR_ECHO."

The 4 drones extend metallic limbs, searching the entire house, making a mess of it in the process. One of them looks into the open drawer full of tech.

**Drone_45:** "Old world equipments recognised. Fact: Citizen possesses more than one contraband. No source of ERR_ECHO identified."

PA system comes online once again, this time with a softer voice.

**The Keeper:** "Stop wasting time. You need to find him. Access nearby cameras and find me the source of that voice."

Jax crawls through the vent in panic, hoping he can leave before the drones realize where he is and lock the entire sector down.

He eventually reaches a maintenance tunnel, and forces the panel off to leave the vent. He drops down into the dark hallway, checking each direction before picking a random one to keep going.

**Jax:** "Damn it.. Where the hell am I?"

He reaches the end of the hallway with a door.

> "AIR FILTER NO_7"
> "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL AND DRONES ONLY."

**Jax:** "Jackpot."

He takes out a scratched keycard from his bag, and holds it against the keypad next to the door. The door opens automatically without a noise.

He enters the large, loud, industrial room, very different from the ones on the surface. He walks towards a large machine connected to a big pipe that seems to diagonally go upwards. He struggles, but manages to open the maintenance hatch marked with a "DANGER" sign and slip inside the operating machine.

He pulls out a flashlight, illuminating the dark, cramped space. He can feel the air rushing in from the pipe and into the filters behind him.

**Jax:** "Welp. I guess I better be quick."

He begins climbing the slope, grateful that it is not slippery.

After nearly an hour, he eventually perceives light, reaching the end of the tunnel. He looks outside from the vent cover, ensuring no one is there. He pushes on the cover, which drops on the ground with a clang.

Leaving the dusty vent into a small building, he quickly makes his way to the nearest exit after putting the vent cover back on while avoiding the patrolling drones. Seeing the door is guarded by Prism drones, he decides to climb out from yet another ventilation shaft into the outside world.

He drops on a brown-grey dirt surface and begins crawling away from the building, the hex-shield of the dome looming in the distance behind him across the strait.

As he gets further away from the dome, he stands up, walking northwest towards the old Kuala Lumpur.

After 3 hours of walking through ruins of the destroyed Johor Bahru, he reaches a bunker with a seemingly alive drone on wheels in front of the door, made of repurposed materials.

**Jax:** "Uh. Hello. I... Can I enter? I just escaped the Dome and I need--"

**Drone:** Unknown life signal detected. Please wait here.

Jax stares at the drone as it drives into the bunker and disappears behind the door. He waits for a few minutes before the door opens again, this time with a man in a hazmat suit in front of the drone.

**Null:** "Escaped the dome, eh? Who helped you?"

**Jax:** "I don't know much about him.. He calls himself Jabat and helps me smuggle in old tech into the dome. Well, not anymore, I can't really go back there."

The Null stares at him behind the mask for a few moments before stepping aside.

**Null:** "Whatever. Come in and we'll clean you."

They walk into an empty room, with two other doors. The gate behind them closes, leaving the dim lamp overhead as the only source of light. 

**Null:** "Go through this door and take you clothes off. Don't worry, there are no cameras."

Jax walks through the door on the right, entering yet another empty room with a shower in the corner.

**Null (Through speakers):** "Take all of your clothes off and put them into the hole in the wall. Your bag too. Then tell me when and I'll decompress the room as you take your mask off."

Jax undresses and puts all of his belongings except his mask into the hatch.

**Jax:** Alright, I'm taking it off.

The room suddenly becomes a vacuum, and Jax takes off his mask, putting it next to his other belongings and closing its cover, which seals itself.

After a few more moments, clean air is pumped back in the air, making Jax able to breathe again.

**Null (Through speakers):** Use the shower in the corner to clean yourself of the remaining dust, especially your hair. We'll provide you towels clothes and in a bit.

He steps into the shower and turns the water on, which is at a surprisingly pleasant temperature. He cleans his hair and body using the provided generic shampoo and soap.

The hatch in the wall opens by itself, with a clean towel and plain clothes inside. Jax wears the slightly large clothes, but doesn't complain.

**Jax:** "I'm clean now?"

**Null (Through speakers):** "I'll open the door in a second."

After a few seconds, the door opens, and Jax leaves the room to see him again, this time without a hazmat suit. He's a bearded, well-built man with a scar on the side of his face.

**Null:** "Follow me."

Jax follows the man through the hallway and then downstairs, until they reach another door. The man steps aside and signals for Jax to open the door himself.
